# Feeding-Frenzy-JAVA

This program generates a simplified version of the popular "Feeding Frenzy" game,
a UML diagram is included for clear representation of all classes involved.

The main code to run is under feedingfrenzy.java, two external JARS are also included for configuration of the code. 

PREMISE: a player (represented by an orange fish) should move via arrow keys 
and must "eat" randomly placed smaller fish to grow in size
          
TO WIN: Be the largest fish on the screen (size is determined by the height of the fish)

GAME OVER: Don't get eaten by the larger fish!
